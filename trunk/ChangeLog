 * Makefile.am:
     Proper building of the scripts.

 * configure.ac:
     Smarter checking of dependencies (required vs. optional).
     Configure-time substitution into lib-vidprofile (version
          and pnmpsnr dependency).

 * lib-vidprofile:
     Added precho and check_optional_dependency.

 * profile:
     Added new precho function calls.

 * vidpsnr:
     Added new precho function calls.

 * psnrcore:
     Added new precho function calls.

 * man pages:
     Written and added; created with txt2tags (sf.net).

 * lib-vidprofile:
     Common functions and constants taken from the suite to create
          a new library.

 * profile:
     Added -help option and formatted usage guide.
     -psnr option now compares against the source video (not the
          control video any longer); also, the entire video may be
          used as a basis for PSNR calculation.
     -snapshot now takes a snapshot of the source video (and didn't
          before, only the control video).
     -test handling considerably simplified and generalized. Tests
          are put in a colon-spearated list and called according to
          type. Allows full set of mpeg2enc options to be tested, and
          inter-dependence calculations between any two numerical
          options.
     -errlog has a new default: /dev/null
 
 * psnrcore:
     Added -help option and formatted usage guide.
 
 * vidpsnr:
     Added -help option and formatted usage guide.

 * profile:
     Added command line interpretation for every option. Basic input
          checks are also carried out.
     Added the capability to use configuration files
          * Without a config file explicitly specified on the command
          line, the default (if it exists) will be read. Any command
          line options given will override the default config files
          options.
          * With an explicitly specified config file, only the command
          line options following the config file will override the
          options given in the file.

 * profile: 
     Added Peak Signal to Noise Ratio calculation.
     Added data processing (time mutliplier, bitrate, and normalized
          data are calculated).
     Streamlined code for testing parameters that take decimal values
          (eg -N test)
     Removed dependency on idvid for independent users.

 * psnrcore: 
     Fixed same-frame bug. Before, the script would exit with errors
          when two frames were the same. Now, two frames can be the
          same and appropriate action is taken (ERROR_SUM is carried
          on for the final PSNR, while the individual frame PSNR is
          recorded as "inf").
     Formatted log output to comply with CSV files.
     Optimized finding which frames to test. Before, the number of
          frames were compared, but only the case when the 2nd
          directory had fewer frames than the 1st was addressed. Now, 
          the 1st directory may have fewer frames than the 2nd and the 
          script will properly run.
     Streamlined various variable assignments. Much less disk activity.
 
 * vidpsnr: 
     extracted the calculation engine from the frames-creation 
          process, allowing the engine to be accessed directly from 
          other scripts (eg profile).
