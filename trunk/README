# Tests to run #
################

# Which options of mpeg2enc should be tested?
# See 'man mpeg2enc' for further option explanations.
# Uncomment a test to run that test.

# Flags
#-test "-p"
#-test "-H"
#-test "-s"
#-test "-c"

# Single ranges
# The syntax is:
# [option] [min] [max] [step]
# [step] may be a decimal as long as [max] has the same 
#   number of decimal points.
#     eg "-N 0 2.0 0.4" is OK, while
#        "-N 0 2   0.4" is not.
#-test "-R 0 2 1"
#-test "-E -40 40 5"
#-test "-r 8 32 8"
#-test "-D 9 10 1"
#-test "-N 0.0 2.0 0.4"

# Double ranges
# The syntax is:
# [option1] [min1] [max1] [step1] [min2] [max2] [step2]
# [step1|2] may be a decimal as long as [max1|2] has the 
#   same number of decimal points.
# The second option range is tested fully for each case 
#   of the first option.
#     eg "-b 800 9800 500 -q 1 18 1" means run 
#     -q 1 18 1 for -b 800, then increment -b, repeat
#-test "-b 800 9800 500 -q 1 18 1"
#-test "-4 1 4 1 -2 1 4 1"
#-test "-Q 0 5 1 -X 0 1000 100"
#-test "-G 2 24 2 -g 2 24 2"

#################
# Other options #
#################

# encframes (default: the whole movie)
# How many frames should mplayer send to mpeg2enc?
# To encode the entire input file, comment this line, 
#   or set the the number of frames to more than the 
#   frames in the input file.
# 450 frames play just longer than 15sec (NTSC) or 18sec (PAL)
#-encframe 450

# keepvids
# Keep the videos mpeg2enc creates?
# The script leaves the movies in the same directory from 
#   which it was called.
#-keepvids

# snapshot
# Take a frame from each test?
# If so, which one? (must be less than either the number of 
#   frames mplayer sends to mpeg2enc, above, or the amount of 
#   frames in the entire input file) The script leaves the snap 
#   shots in the same directory from which it was called.
#-snapshot 50

# psnr
# Find the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio?
# If so, how many frames should be compared? (must be less 
#   than either the number of frames mplayer sends to mpeg2enc, 
#   above, or the amount of frames in the entire input file)
# Comment for every frame of the encoded videos. 
# NOTE: each frame is about 1MB, please have sufficient space in the
#   present working directory.
#-psnr 60
